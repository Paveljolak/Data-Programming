This readme describes the GeoNames Postal Code dataset.
The main GeoNames gazetteer data extract is here: http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/


Supported countries: nearly 100 countries are currently supported. New countries area added when the national postal service starts publishing data under a compatible license.

For many countries lat/lng are determined with an algorithm that searches the place names in the main geonames database 
using administrative divisions and numerical vicinity of the postal codes as factors in the disambiguation of place names. 
For postal codes and place name for which no corresponding toponym in the main geonames database could be found an average 
lat/lng of 'neighbouring' postal codes is calculated.
Please let us know if you find any errors in the data set. Thanks
